/*We have a parrot that likes to squawk at night in its cage when itâ€™s scared. Write a method named getUp that has 2 parameters
* 1st parameter should be a boolean squawking- it represent the parrot.
* 2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is an int named currentHour has a valid range of 0-23.
* We have to get up if the parrot is squawking before 6 or after 22 hours so in that case return true.
* All other cases will return false. If the currentHour parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false*/
