<h2> Hey!! i'm Carlos!</h2>
<h3> I am looking forward to becoming an expert at this</h3>

<p> As I begin this journey, I hope to learn everything there is to become a developer.  I have worked with various technologies but nothing has called my attention the most like the back-end of the code making those applications work.  I look forward to this new challenge and becoming a mentor to someone like me in the future. 	

My 3 top favorite things are;

<ol>
	
	<li> Being a father to my Son Sebastian </li>
	<li> Leaning new technologies </li>
	<li> Traveling </li>

</ol>	

	</p>
